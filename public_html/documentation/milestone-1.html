<h1>Purpose</h1>
<p> Since my PWP is going to be my own personal professional portfolio I would like to use it as
    a resource for potential employers to find me and to learn more about my experience and
    skills. This professional portfolio will demonstrate my web development skills and where I
    can talk about the experience I have gained as an intern at Deep Dive Full Stack.
</p>

<h1> Audience </h1>
<p> My audience for this project will be potential employers and/or hiring personal including;
    recruiters, HR personal, hiring managers and tech leads. I would like to attract this
    audience on both a local and national scope.
</p>

<h1> Goal</h1>
<p>The goal of my project is to help me acquire an internship or gainful employment. I would
    like to be employed full time but any experience I can gain from this project will be very
    beneficial on my journey to become a full stack web developer.</p>
